---

## 19. Global Search (Phase 13)

Phase 13 introduces no new database tables. All search queries execute against existing tables using EF Core LINQ joins:

| Entity searched | Table(s) queried |
|---|---|
| Students | `student_profiles` JOIN `users` |
| Courses | `courses` |
| Course Offerings | `course_offerings` JOIN `courses` JOIN `semesters` |
| Faculty | `users` JOIN `roles` (where `roles.name = 'Faculty'`) |
| Departments | `departments` |
| Student-enrolled offerings | `enrollments` JOIN `course_offerings` JOIN `courses` |

All queries respect global soft-delete query filters (`is_deleted = 0`) automatically.

Role-scoped filtering applied at the application service layer:
- **SuperAdmin** — all entities across all departments
- **Admin** — entities within their assigned departments
- **Faculty** — entities within their own department + their own course offerings
- **Student** — only their enrolled course offerings

**EF Migration:** None required (no schema changes)

---

## 18. Design Guarantees

- License contains **no university identity**
- License file is cryptographically protected
- License keys cannot be altered
- Academic data is never deleted
- Module-based feature control supported
- Fully offline-capable license validation

---

## 19. Implementation Conventions (ASP.NET + EF Core)

- Use GUID PKs for all user-facing and distributed entities (users, students, assignments, licenses)
- Use bigint PKs for high-volume append-only logs where sequential inserts are beneficial
- Add created_at, updated_at, and row_version (concurrency token) to mutable aggregates
- Use soft-delete columns (is_deleted, deleted_at) for operational entities; never soft-delete academic history tables
- Store all timestamps in UTC

---

## 21. Constraint and Index Strategy

- users: unique indexes on username and email (filtered where email is not null)
- students: unique index on registration_number and unique index on user_id
- student_course_enrollments: unique composite index on (student_id, course_id, semester_id)
- attendance_records: unique composite index on (student_id, course_id, semester_id, attendance_date)
- assignment_submissions: unique composite index on (assignment_id, student_id)

- notifications_recipients: index on (user_id, is_read)
- audit_logs: clustered index by occurred_at for time-range queries

---

## 22. Data Retention and Archival Rules

- Academic records: never deleted; archive to cold storage after policy threshold
- Audit logs: retain online for 24 months, archive for 7 years
- Notification delivery logs: retain online for 12 months, then archive
- Session and token records: purge expired and revoked entries after 90 days

---

## 23. Migration and Seeding Plan

- Baseline migration: identity, departments, SIS core, license_state
- Seed mandatory roles, modules, and default themes
- Seed Super Admin bootstrap user through secure deployment script
- Apply feature migrations per release train (v1, v1.1, v1.2)
