---

## Phase 2: Academic Core and SIS (Sprints 4-5)

### Objectives
- Implement departments, programs, courses, semesters
- Implement student profile and enrollment workflow
- Preserve permanent academic history

### Deliverables
- Department and program management screens
- Student signup using registration whitelist
- Semester records with immutable history behavior

### Exit Criteria
- Student record creation is fully auditable
- Academic history cannot be deleted via UI or API
- Faculty can only access assigned department data

---

## Phase 3: Assignments and Results (Sprints 6-7)

### Objectives
- Implement assignment lifecycle and submissions
- Implement grading workflows and result publication
- Implement transcript export

### Deliverables
- Assignment creation and submission APIs/UI
- Faculty grading and feedback workflows
- Result publication and transcript export logs

### Exit Criteria
- Assignment submissions enforce one-per-student rule
- Result publication is role-restricted and auditable
- Transcript export appears in audit/report logs

---

## Phase 4: Notifications and Attendance (Sprints 8-9)

### Objectives
- Implement notification engine and recipient tracking
- Implement attendance management and alerts

### Deliverables
- Notification compose, dispatch, read-state tracking
- Attendance daily capture and low-attendance checks
- Scheduled job for attendance alerts

### Exit Criteria
- Notifications tracked per user with read state
- Duplicate attendance entries prevented per day
- Alert job execution visible in operational logs

---

## Phase 5: Quizzes and FYP (Sprints 10-11)

### Objectives
- Implement quiz authoring and attempts
- Implement FYP project and meeting scheduling

### Deliverables
- Quiz question bank, attempts, and scoring
- FYP meetings with panel members and room scheduling
- Student dashboard views for quizzes and FYP events

### Exit Criteria
- Quiz attempts honor configured attempt limits
- FYP meetings generate notifications for stakeholders
- Faculty and department access boundaries verified

---

## Phase 6: AI, Analytics, and Hardening (Sprint 12)

### Objectives
- Integrate AI chatbot with role-aware context
- Implement initial reporting dashboards
- Complete performance and security hardening

### Deliverables
- AI chat endpoint with module/license guardrails
- Core analytics (performance, attendance, results)
- Security checklist completion and load test report

### Exit Criteria
- AI access obeys module and license policies
- p95 response targets met for core endpoints
- UAT sign-off for v1.x release candidate

---

## 4. Cross-Cutting Workstreams

## 4.1 Data and Migration Workstream
- Apply incremental EF Core migrations per phase
- Seed base roles/modules/themes in non-production and production-safe scripts
- Backup and restore runbook validated before each release

## 4.2 Security and Compliance Workstream
- Threat modeling at phase boundaries
- SAST/dependency scanning on each PR
- Audit log completeness checks for privileged operations

## 4.3 Quality Engineering Workstream
- Unit tests for domain and application layers
- Integration tests for API and data persistence
- Contract tests for client-server compatibility
- Regression suite before each milestone release

---

## 5. Definition of Done

A feature is complete only when:

- Functional requirements are implemented and demoed
- Unit and integration tests pass in CI
- Logging, metrics, and audit events are included
- Authorization and module-activation rules are enforced
- API documentation is updated
- No critical or high vulnerabilities remain open

---

## 6. Risk Register and Mitigations

- Licensing complexity risk:
  - Mitigation: implement and test license service early in Phase 1
- Access-control regression risk:
  - Mitigation: centralized policy tests and authorization integration tests
- Performance risk under peak enrollment windows:
  - Mitigation: load testing from Phase 3 onward, cache read-heavy endpoints
- Scope creep risk:
  - Mitigation: lock v1.0 scope and route additional requests to v1.1 or v1.2 backlog

---

## 7. Immediate Next Actions (Week 1)

- Finalize solution structure and repository conventions
- Create initial ASP.NET solution and projects
- Configure CI pipeline with build, test, lint, and security scan
- Implement baseline auth model and role seed
- Draft initial EF Core migration for identity and department core

---

## 8. Execution Status Update (Kickoff)

### Completed

- .NET 8 modular solution scaffold created with `src/` and `tests/` layout
- Projects created: Web, API, Application, Domain, Infrastructure, BackgroundJobs
- Test projects created: UnitTests, IntegrationTests, ContractTests
- Solution files created: `Tabsan.EduSphere.sln` and `Tabsan.EduSphere.slnx`
- Project references wired according to planned architecture direction
- Baseline packages added (FluentValidation, EF Core SQL Server, Serilog, OpenTelemetry, testing stack)
- GitHub Actions CI workflow created at `.github/workflows/dotnet-ci.yml`
- Local validation completed: restore, build, and tests passed

### Next Immediate Implementation Tasks

- Add architecture decision records (ADRs) for auth, data, and module enforcement
- Implement `ApplicationDbContext` and first EF Core migration
- Implement role seed and Super Admin bootstrap flow
- Add first policy-based authorization matrix tests
