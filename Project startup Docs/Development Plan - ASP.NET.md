- Captured evidence per combination for:
  - license upload,
  - institution policy,
  - labels,
  - portal capability matrix row union,
  - progression evaluation by institution type,

  - any combination containing University uses University vocabulary.
- Known tooling caveat persisted:
  - sequential uploads require clearing `consumed_verification_keys` because generated licenses reuse verification-key material.
- Phase 3 completed.

  - successful license activation,
  - policy flags,
  - labels vocabulary,
  - portal capability matrix rows,
  - progression evaluation result by institution type,
  - DB policy-key confirmation in `portal_settings`.
- Results summary:
  - School: Grade/Promotion flow active, school-only matrix rows.
  - College: Year/Progression flow active, college-only matrix rows.
  - University: Semester/GPA flow active, university-only matrix rows.
- Known tooling caveat noted in validation:
  - generated licenses currently reuse verification key; sequential mode validation required resetting `consumed_verification_keys` between activations.
- Phase 2 completed.

### 2026-05-12 - Institution License Validation Phase 1 (Execution Snapshot)
- Ran Phase 1 endpoint validation using SuperAdmin credentials and HTTPS API host.
- Baseline observed:
  - license status: `Invalid`
  - license details: `None`
  - institution policy: `University=true`, `School=false`, `College=false`
- Attempted `.tablic` upload from `tools/Tabsan.Lic/License`.
- Initial upload failure root cause: DB save failed due legacy non-null `license_state` columns (`InstitutionScope`, `ExpiryType`) without defaults.
- Applied environment-level SQL defaults for those legacy columns and retried upload.
- Retry succeeded with `License activated successfully`.
- Post-upload state: `license status=Active`, `license details=Active (Yearly)`, policy remained `University=true`, `School=false`, `College=false`.
- Final module restriction validation via `GET /api/v1/portal-capabilities/matrix` confirmed `school=false`, `college=false`, `university=true` with no School/College-enabled rows.
- Phase 1 completed.

- Unit and integration tests pass in CI
- Logging, metrics, and audit events are included
- Authorization and module-activation rules are enforced
- API documentation is updated
- No critical or high vulnerabilities remain open

---

## 6. Risk Register and Mitigations

- Licensing complexity risk:
  - Mitigation: implement and test license service early in Phase 1; Tabsan-Lic built as Phase 7
- Access-control regression risk:
  - Mitigation: centralized policy tests and authorization integration tests
- Performance risk under peak enrollment windows:
  - Mitigation: load testing from Phase 3 onward; SQL Views and Stored Procedures in Phase 10
- Scope creep risk:
  - Mitigation: v1.0 scope locked; Phases 7–10 routed to v1.2/v1.3 release train
- Finance/payment integration risk:
  - Mitigation: finance workflow built without gateway first; gateway added as a toggled add-on module
- Email delivery risk:
  - Mitigation: `IEmailSender` abstraction allows provider swap without code changes; SMTP fallback always available
- Student lifecycle complexity risk:
  - Mitigation: graduation, semester promotion, and dropout handled as discrete admin operations with individual audit trails
- Security hardening risk:
  - Mitigation: OWASP checklist tracked from Phase 1; dedicated Sprint 19 for final hardening and pen test
