- Captured evidence in `Artifacts/Phase4/ModeRole/20260512-142021` for:
  - `GET /api/v1/institution-policy`
  - `GET /api/v1/labels`
  - `GET /api/v1/portal-capabilities/matrix`
  - `GET /api/v1/dashboard/context`
  - `GET /api/v1/reports` plus scoped report data/export endpoints
  - negative authorization checks (`admin-user`, `license/details`, student operational report access)
- Mode-level results:
  - School labels: `Grade/Promotion/Percentage/Subject/Class`
  - College labels: `Year/Progression/Percentage/Subject/Year-Group`
  - University labels: `Semester/Progression/GPA/CGPA/Course/Batch`
- Role-level results:
  - SuperAdmin/Admin/Faculty can access scoped report data and exports with valid filters.
  - Student remains restricted from operational report data/exports (`403`) while report catalog remains role-filtered.
- Phase 4 status: complete.

### 2026-05-12 — Institution License Validation Phase 3 (Execution Snapshot)
- Completed mixed-mode license coverage validation for:
  - School + College
  - School + University
  - College + University
  - School + College + University
- Captured endpoint evidence for policy, labels, capability matrix, grading-profile lookups, progression evaluations, and DB policy-key persistence.
- Validated union behavior:
  - policy flags and capability matrix rows align with licensed institution combinations,
  - persisted `institution_include_*` keys match each uploaded combination.
- Observed current label-resolution behavior:
  - School+College resolves to School vocabulary,
  - combinations containing University resolve to University vocabulary.

  - `GET /api/v1/institution-policy`
  - `GET /api/v1/labels`
  - `GET /api/v1/portal-capabilities/matrix`
  - `POST /api/v1/progression/evaluate`

- Results:
  - School mode -> Grade/Promotion vocabulary, school-only matrix rows, school progression evaluation path.
  - College mode -> Year/Progression vocabulary, college-only matrix rows, college progression evaluation path.
  - University mode -> Semester/GPA vocabulary, university-only matrix rows, university progression evaluation path.
- Known test-environment caveat: generator currently emits licenses that share the same verification key; sequential mode uploads required clearing `consumed_verification_keys` between activations for validation flow continuity.
- Phase 2 status: complete.

### 2026-05-12 — Institution License Validation Phase 1 (Execution Snapshot)
- Executed Phase 1 checks against running API/Web environments.

  - `GET /api/v1/license/details` -> `None`
  - `GET /api/v1/institution-policy` -> `includeUniversity=true`, `includeSchool=false`, `includeCollege=false`
- Attempted license import using generated `.tablic` file from `tools/Tabsan.Lic/License`.
- Result: upload rejected with `License validation failed. The file may be invalid or tampered.`
- Root cause identified in API logs: database insert failed due legacy `license_state` non-null columns (`InstitutionScope`, `ExpiryType`) without defaults.
- Applied environment remediation defaults for legacy columns and re-ran upload.
- Re-run result: `License activated successfully`.
- Post-activation state:
  - `GET /api/v1/license/status` -> `Active`
  - `GET /api/v1/license/details` -> `Active` (`Yearly`, 365 remaining days)
  - `GET /api/v1/institution-policy` -> `includeUniversity=true`, `includeSchool=false`, `includeCollege=false`
- Final module/menu restriction validation:
  - `GET /api/v1/portal-capabilities/matrix` confirmed `school=false`, `college=false`, `university=true`

- **Download behavior:** certificate generation and media streaming now preserve filename-aware downloads across signed local and redirect-first flows.
- **Phase outcome:** Stage 28.3 is complete, and with Stages 28.1 and 28.2 already delivered, Phase 28 is complete.
- **Schema impact:** no database migration required.
- **Validation:** solution build passed; automated tests passed **162/162**.

### 2026-05-10 — Phase 29 Stage 29.1
- **Index baseline:** added composite indexes for high-frequency student/user/status recency queries across graduation applications, support tickets, notification recipients, payment receipts, quiz attempts, and user sessions.
- **Migration:** added `20260509155457_20260510_Phase29_IndexBaseline`.
- **Schema audit:** current model contains no `InstitutionId`, `YearId`, or `GradeId` columns, so Stage 29.1 targeted existing `StudentId`/`UserId`/`CourseId`/`SemesterId` shaped contracts instead.
- **Validation:** solution build passed; automated tests passed **162/162**.

### 2026-05-10 — Phase 29 Stage 29.2 Slice 1

- **Validation:** solution build passed; automated tests passed **162/162**.

### 2026-05-10 — Phase 29 Stage 29.3
- **Archive policy:** added `Scripts/3-Phase29-ArchivePolicy.sql` with retention matrix, dry-run candidate counts, and optional batched cleanup mode.
- **Index maintenance:** added `Scripts/4-Phase29-IndexMaintenance.sql` with fragmentation-threshold reorganize/rebuild planning and execution mode.
- **Capacity dashboards:** added `Scripts/5-Phase29-CapacityGrowthDashboard.sql` for table-size snapshots and recent growth signals.
- **Operational runbook:** updated `Scripts/README.md` with Stage 29.3 command flow.
- **Schema impact:** no database migration required.
- **Validation:** solution build passed; automated tests passed **162/162**.

### 2026-05-10 — Phase 29 Complete
- Stage 29.1, Stage 29.2 (all slices), and Stage 29.3 are complete.
- MSSQL optimization scope now includes index baseline, heavy-list pagination discipline, and operational lifecycle maintenance artifacts.

### 2026-05-10 — Phase 28 Stage 28.3 Slice 1
- **File/media abstraction:** introduced provider-based API storage contract (`IMediaStorageService`) and local implementation (`LocalMediaStorageService`) to remove endpoint-level hard-coded file persistence.
- **First migrated flow:** payment proof upload now stores through the provider and persists storage object keys as metadata.
- **Configuration:** added `MediaStorage` section (provider/local root/public base URL/key prefix) in API appsettings files for future object-storage/CDN migration.
- **Schema impact:** no database migration required.
- **Validation:** solution build passed.

### 2026-05-09 — Phase 28 Stage 28.1 API and App Tier Scaling Complete
- **Load-balancer readiness:** expanded forwarded-header handling on the API and added forwarded-header handling to the Web tier for reverse-proxy deployments.
- **Stateless app nodes:** removed Web portal dependence on ASP.NET server session for API base URL, access token, session identity, and forced-password-change state; these now use protected cookies.
- **Shared key management:** Web startup now supports an optional shared data-protection key-ring path so multiple nodes can decrypt the same protected cookies.
- **Payload efficiency:** enabled Brotli/Gzip response compression on API and Web, and configured JSON serialization to omit null fields.
- **Schema impact:** no database migration required.
- **Validation:** solution build passed; automated test suite passed **160/160**.

- **Background workloads:** large notification fan-out batches are now deferred to a hosted worker that persists recipients in chunks.
- **Validation:** solution build passed; automated test suite passed **162/162**.

### 2026-05-10 — Phase 28 Stage 28.2 Completion
- **Report generation workloads:** queued result-summary export jobs now support asynchronous generation, status polling, and deferred download.
- **Large recalculation workloads:** queued result publish-all jobs now run in the background with job-state polling.
- **Scalability outcome:** Stage 28.2 objectives are fully met with distributed cache hot paths plus background offload for notification fan-out, report generation, and recalculation operations.
- **Schema impact:** no database migration required.
- **Validation:** solution build passed; automated test suite passed **162/162**.

### 2026-05-08 — Phase 16 Faculty Grading System Complete
- **Stage 16.1 — Gradebook Grid View:** `GradebookController` (GET/PUT/POST endpoints), `GradebookService` (GetGradebookAsync, UpsertEntryAsync, PublishAllAsync), `GradebookRepository` (3-way join for student info), `Gradebook.cshtml` (inline edit + publish-all).
- **Stage 16.2 — Rubric-Based Grading:** Domain entities `Rubric`/`RubricCriterion`/`RubricLevel`/`RubricStudentGrade`, EF configs, `RubricRepository`, `RubricService`, `RubricController`, `RubricManage.cshtml`, `RubricView.cshtml`.

  - EF migration `20260507133254_Phase15_EnrollmentRules` — creates `course_prerequisites` table + unique index `IX_course_prerequisites_course_prereq`.
- **Stage 15.2 — Timetable Clash Detection:**
  - `TryEnrollAsync` joins timetable entries for requested and already-enrolled offerings; rejects enrollment on time overlap.
  - Admin `OverrideClash` flag bypasses clash check; override reason is audit-logged.
- **Stage 15.3 — Capacity Limits (already implemented):**
  - `CourseOffering.MaxEnrollment` already enforced; `UpdateMaxEnrollment` API action in place.

  - `CourseController.GetAll` + `GetOfferings`: `Forbid()` → empty-list for out-of-scope dept requests
  - `CourseController.GetMyOfferings` for Faculty: changed from `FacultyUserId` filter to dept-assignment scope filter; fixes Assignments/Attendance/Results/Quizzes dropdowns
  - `StudentController.GetAll` for Faculty: removed `Forbid()`, silently scopes to allowed departments
  - `FypController.admin-create`: policy changed from `"Admin"` to `"Faculty"`
  - `PortalController.Fyp()` Faculty branch: loads students for FYP creation workflow
  - `Fyp.cshtml`: "Create Project" button + `createFypModal` now render for Faculty role
- Validation: 0 build errors; 78/78 tests passed

  - Student can request FYP completion (`POST /api/v1/fyp/{id}/request-completion`)
  - Faculty can approve completion (`POST /api/v1/fyp/{id}/approve-completion`); FYP auto-completes when all assigned faculty approve
  - Approval progress counter shown in portal (`approved/required`)
  - Completed FYP result row rendered inside student Results page
  - EF migration `Phase4FypCompletionApprovalFlow` added for approval state persistence
- **Auth consistency hardening**
  - Login flow resolves portal API base URL before token acquisition, eliminating intermittent student-page 401s
- Validation: 12/12 assignment integration tests passed; 78/78 full suite passed; 0 build errors

### 2026-05-06 — Issue-Fix Phase 4 Option A/C Complete (Web UI Import + Forced Password Change)
- Added/validated portal user import flow:
  - User Import page + CSV upload form + import summary rendering
  - CSV upload wired to `POST /api/v1/user-import/csv`

### 2026-05-06 — Issue-Fix Phase 6 Kickoff (Admin Multi-Department Assignment — now complete)
- Phase 6.1/6.2 fully implemented. Admin multi-department assignment model delivers final Stage 5.4 scope enforcement.

### 2026-05-06 — Issue-Fix Phase 2 Complete (Shared Portal and Settings)
- **Stage 2.1 (Branding and Asset Rendering - completed)**
  - Fixed `PortalSettingsController.UploadLogo` null-webroot failure by adding fallback to `ContentRootPath/wwwroot` when `WebRootPath` is not set.
  - Fixed API static file serving for branding assets by configuring `UseStaticFiles` with an explicit `PhysicalFileProvider` rooted at API `wwwroot`.
  - Uploaded logos are now accessible via `/portal-uploads/*` and render in the Web sidebar branding block.
- **Stage 2.2 (Privacy Policy Editing - completed)**
  - Verified dashboard branding settings include privacy content editor fields and persistence.
  - Verified `Home/Privacy` renders configured privacy policy content from portal settings.
- **Stage 2.3 (Shared Course Offering Dropdowns - completed)**

### 2026-05-05 — Phase 3 Complete (License App — Generator Alignment + File Security)
- **Stage 3.1 (Generator Alignment — completed)**
  - Added `MaxUsers` (int, 0=unlimited) and `AllowedDomain` (string?) to `IssuedKey` model in `tools/Tabsan.Lic`
  - Configured new columns in `LicDb` EF fluent model; startup SQLite migration in `Program.cs` auto-upgrades existing `tabsan_lic.db` files
  - Extended `LicenseBuilder.TablicPayload` to embed `MaxUsers` and `AllowedDomain` in the encrypted .tablic binary payload
  - `Program.cs` now prompts operator for MaxUsers and AllowedDomain during .tablic generation (option 3)
  - `HandleListKeys` shows MaxUsers/AllowedDomain per row; `ExportCsvAsync` includes both in CSV output
- **Stage 3.2 (File Security — pre-existing, verified)**
  - P3-S2-01: `LicCrypto.BuildTablicFile()` generates AES-256-CBC encrypted + RSA-2048 signed .tablic files; `LicenseValidationService` verifies signature and decrypts on every activation
  - P3-S2-02: RSA signature covers `SHA-256(IV + ciphertext)`; private key is tool-only; any payload modification → invalid signature → rejected; replay guard via `ConsumedVerificationKey` table
- **Build**: `dotnet build tools/Tabsan.Lic/Tabsan.Lic.csproj --no-restore` → 0 errors; full solution also 0 errors

### 2026-05-05 — Phase 2 Complete (License Concurrency + Domain Binding)
- **Stage 2.1 (Concurrency User Limit + SuperAdmin Exemption - completed)**
  - Added `MaxUsers` property to `LicenseState` domain entity; deserialized from .tablic binary payload
  - Added `CountActiveSessionsAsync()` to session repository; counts active sessions (RevokedAt=null AND ExpiresAt>UtcNow)
  - Updated `AuthService.LoginAsync()` to enforce concurrency limit: if MaxUsers > 0 and active session count >= MaxUsers, reject non-SuperAdmin login with HTTP 403
  - SuperAdmin always exempt from concurrency checks; can always login
- **Stage 2.2 (Unlimited Mode - completed)**
  - Implemented `MaxUsers == 0` as unlimited mode; skips all concurrency checks for that license state
- **Stage 2.3 (Domain Binding + Anti-Tamper - completed)**
  - Added `ActivatedDomain` property to `LicenseState`; captures request domain on first activation
  - Extended `.tablic` binary payload parsing to support optional `AllowedDomain` field from license issuer
  - Created `LicenseDomainMiddleware` that rejects cross-domain requests with HTTP 403 unless on whitelisted endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/license/upload`, `/api/v1/license/status`)
  - Prevents single license from being reused across multiple deployments; one license per domain
  - Anti-tamper: RSA-2048 signature + AES-256-CBC encryption + replay guard via ConsumedVerificationKey table + domain binding
- **Changed return type of IAuthService.LoginAsync** from `LoginResponse?` to `LoginResult` to differentiate failure reasons (invalid credentials vs concurrency limit reached)
- **EF Core migration created**: `20260505_Phase2LicenseConcurrency.cs` — adds MaxUsers and ActivatedDomain columns to license_state table
- **Build status**: 0 errors, all Phase 2 code compiles successfully

### 2026-05-05 — Phase 1 Remediation Restart (Batch 3)
- **Stage 1.3 (Result Summary InvalidOperationException - completed)**
  - Root cause identified in `ReportRepository.GetResultDataAsync()` query pipeline: EF Core could not translate `OrderBy` over projected `ResultReportRow` (`could not be translated`).
  - Fixed query by moving sort to SQL-side entity fields (`orderby u.Username, c.Code`) before projection in `BuildResultQuery()`.
  - Removed post-projection `OrderBy` calls in `GetResultDataAsync()` and `GetSemesterResultDataAsync()`.
- **SuperAdmin always-available enforcement (reports data endpoints)**
  - Updated `ReportController` data/export endpoints from faculty policy to explicit roles: `SuperAdmin,Admin,Faculty`.

- **Validation:**
  - Live API validation succeeded: `GET /api/v1/reports/result-summary` with SuperAdmin token returned `rows=21` and `totalRecords=21`.
  - File diagnostics report no errors in modified files.

### 2026-05-05 — Phase 1 Remediation Restart (Batch 2)
- **Stage 1.4 (menu and scripts cleanup - completed)**

## Phase 22 — External Integrations ✅ Implemented (2026-05-08)

### 22.A Overview
Connects the portal to external third-party systems (library catalogue) and enables on-demand accreditation/government reporting. Both integration surfaces are configurable by SuperAdmin without code deployment.

### 22.B Functional Requirements

#### Stage 22.1 — Library System Integration
- SuperAdmin configures library catalogue URL + optional API token via `PUT /api/v1/library/config`.
- Authenticated users retrieve their own loan status via `GET /api/v1/library/loans` (proxied to external API).
- Admin/SuperAdmin can look up any student's loans via `GET /api/v1/library/loans/{studentIdentifier}`.
- Portal view: `LibraryConfig.cshtml` for SuperAdmin configuration.

#### Stage 22.2 — Government / Accreditation Reporting
- SuperAdmin defines `AccreditationTemplate` entries (name, description, field mappings, format, active state).
- `GET /api/v1/accreditation/{id}/generate` materialises data, streams report as CSV or plain-text PDF, and writes an audit-log entry.
- All template CRUD restricted to SuperAdmin; report generation accessible to Admin + SuperAdmin.

### 22.C Technical Implementation
- **Domain:** `AccreditationTemplate` entity (`Domain/Settings/AccreditationTemplate.cs`); `AccreditationTemplateConfiguration` EF config.
- **Persistence:** Table `accreditation_templates`; EF migration `Phase22_ExternalIntegrations`.
- **Application:** `ILibraryService` + `LibraryService`; `IAccreditationService` + `AccreditationService`; `IAccreditationRepository`; DTOs in `Application/DTOs/External/`.
- **API:** `LibraryController` (`api/v1/library`); `AccreditationController` (`api/v1/accreditation`).
- **Web:** `LibraryConfig.cshtml`, `AccreditationTemplates.cshtml`; sidebar entries `library_config` + `accreditation` (Settings group).
- **Validation:** 0 build errors · migration applied · commit `dddee69`

## Phase 23 — Core Policy Foundation ✅ Implemented (2026-05-09)

### 23.A Overview
Establishes the institution-type policy kernel so every downstream feature can adapt behaviour to School, College, or University mode without duplicating logic. Provides a cached, per-request policy snapshot consumed by middleware and downstream services.

### 23.B Functional Requirements

#### Stage 23.1 — License Policy Kernel
- `InstitutionType` enum: `University = 0` (default), `School = 1`, `College = 2`.
- `IInstitutionPolicyService` with 10-minute `IMemoryCache` backing and `portal_settings` persistence.
- SuperAdmin controls which institution types are enabled; at least one must always be active.
- `GET /api/v1/institution-policy` (all authenticated); `PUT /api/v1/institution-policy` (SuperAdmin only).

#### Stage 23.2 — Institution Context Resolution
- `InstitutionContextMiddleware` resolves snapshot per-request and stores it in `HttpContext.Items`.
- Extension method `GetInstitutionPolicy()` provides safe access with `Default` fallback (University-only).

#### Stage 23.3 — Role-Rights Hardening
- SuperAdmin portal page `InstitutionPolicy.cshtml` — three-flag toggle form.
- Sidebar module `institution_policy` (sort 33, SuperAdmin).

### 23.C Technical Implementation
- **Domain:** `Domain/Enums/InstitutionType.cs`.
- **Application:** `IInstitutionPolicyService` + `InstitutionPolicySnapshot` + `SaveInstitutionPolicyCommand`; `InstitutionPolicyService`; `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory 8.0.1` added.
- **API:** `InstitutionPolicyController`; `InstitutionContextMiddleware` (registered after `UseAuthorization`).
- **Web:** `PortalController.InstitutionPolicy`; `InstitutionPolicy.cshtml`; `EduApiClient` 2 new methods.
- **Persistence:** No migration — uses existing `portal_settings` table.
- **Validation:** 0 build errors · 27/27 unit tests · commit `28cac36`

### 24.B Functional Requirements

#### Stage 24.1 — Module Registry
- `ModuleDescriptor` sealed record: `Key`, `RequiredRoles[]`, `AllowedTypes[]?`, `IsLicenseGated`.
- `ModuleRegistry` static catalogue of all 14 modules; `IModuleRegistryService` combines registry with live activation + institution policy.
- `GET api/v1/module-registry/visible` returns per-user module visibility list.

#### Stage 24.2 — Dynamic Labels
- `ILabelService` / `LabelService` returns institution-appropriate `AcademicVocabulary` (Semester↔Grade↔Year, GPA↔Percentage, Course↔Subject, Batch↔Class↔Year-Group).
- `GET api/v1/labels` — all authenticated roles.

#### Stage 24.3 — Dashboard Composition
- `IDashboardCompositionService` / `DashboardCompositionService` — 10-widget catalogue filtered by role + institution type.

## Phase 25 — Academic Engine Unification ✅ Implemented (2026-05-09)

### 25.A Overview
Adds a pluggable result-calculation engine that supports GPA-based (University) and percentage-based (School/College) grading in parallel, alongside configurable institution grading profiles stored in the database and a student progression/promotion service that honours institution-specific pass thresholds.

### 25.B Functional Requirements

#### Stage 25.1 — Result Calculation Strategy Pattern
- `IResultCalculationStrategy` contract: converts component marks + configuration → `ResultSummary` (score, grade point, percentage, grade label, isPassing).
- `GpaResultStrategy` (University): weighted percentage → GPA on 0.0–4.0 scale. Pass = GPA ≥ threshold.
- `PercentageResultStrategy` (School/College): weighted percentage → grade band label. Built-in A+/A/B+/B/C/D/F bands; overridable via JSON. Pass = % ≥ threshold.
- `IResultStrategyResolver` / `ResultStrategyResolver` (singleton DI): maps `InstitutionType` → strategy. Zero changes to existing `ResultService`.

#### Stage 25.2 — Institution Grading Profiles
- `InstitutionGradingProfile` entity: one per institution type (unique index). Stores `PassThreshold` and `GradeRangesJson`.
- Threshold validation: University 0–4.0; School/College 0–100.
- `IInstitutionGradingService` / `InstitutionGradingService`: `GetAllAsync`, `GetByTypeAsync`, `UpsertAsync` (create-or-update semantics).
- `InstitutionGradingProfileController`:
  - `GET api/v1/institution-grading-profiles` — Admin+
  - `GET api/v1/institution-grading-profiles/{type}` — Admin+
  - `PUT api/v1/institution-grading-profiles/{type}` — SuperAdmin only

#### Stage 25.3 — Progression / Promotion Logic
- `IProgressionService` / `ProgressionService`:
  - University: CGPA ≥ pass threshold; period = "Semester N".
  - School: `CurrentSemesterGpa` (as %) ≥ pass threshold; period = "Grade N".
  - College: `CurrentSemesterGpa` (as %) ≥ pass threshold; period = "Year N".
  - Default thresholds if no profile: 2.0 (University), 40 (School/College).
- `EvaluateAsync`: read-only evaluation returning `ProgressionDecision`.
- `PromoteAsync`: evaluate + advance student semester; throws `InvalidOperationException` if not eligible.
- `ProgressionController`:
  - `POST api/v1/progression/evaluate` — Admin+
  - `POST api/v1/progression/promote` — Admin+
  - `GET api/v1/progression/me/{type}` — Student (self-view)

### 25.C Technical Implementation
- **Domain:** `InstitutionGradingProfile` entity; `IInstitutionGradingProfileRepository`.
- **Application:** `IResultCalculationStrategy`, `GpaResultStrategy`, `PercentageResultStrategy`, `ResultStrategyResolver`; `InstitutionGradingService`; `ProgressionService`; DTOs in `DTOs/Academic/`.
- **Infrastructure:** `InstitutionGradingProfileRepository`; EF config `InstitutionGradingProfileConfiguration`; migration `20260508152906_Phase25_AcademicEngineUnification`.
- **API:** `InstitutionGradingProfileController`, `ProgressionController`; Phase 25 DI registrations in `Program.cs`.
- **Tests:** 29 new unit tests in `Phase25Tests.cs`; 144/144 total passing.
- **Validation:** 0 build errors · 144/144 unit tests · commit `d2aabd3`
