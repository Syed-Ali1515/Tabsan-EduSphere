# University Portal – Module Definition, Activation & Packaging

**Document Version:** 1.3 (Implementation Baseline — Extended)  
**Aligned With PRD Version:** 1.8  
**Audience:** Super Admin, University Decision Makers  
**Purpose:** Define selectable system modules, activation rules, and pricing packages  

---

## 1. Overview

The University Portal follows a **modular architecture**, allowing universities to choose which functional modules they require.

⚠️ **Important:**  
👉 **License handling is NOT a module.**  
Licenses are created externally and uploaded by the **Super Admin**.  
Modules become available or unavailable **based on license entitlements**, but licensing itself cannot be disabled.

---

## 2. Core System Capabilities (Not Modules)

The following are **mandatory system capabilities** and are **ALWAYS present**:

- Licensing enforcement (key upload & validation)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Super Admin controls
- Security & encryption
- Audit logging (minimum)

✅ These **cannot be turned off** and are not selectable modules.

---

## 3. Module Management Rules

### 3.1 Super Admin Responsibilities
Only the **Super Admin** can:
- Activate or deactivate modules
- Control module availability based on license
- Hide or expose functionality to users
- Enable paid add-on modules

---

### 3.2 Module Activation Behavior

- ✅ **Active Module**
  - Visible in UI
  - APIs enabled

✅ Module toggling does **not delete any data**

## 15. ASP.NET Implementation Mapping

### 15.1 Module-to-Bounded-Context Mapping

| Functional Module | Bounded Context | Primary API Area |
|------|------|------|
| Authentication & Users | Identity and Access | /api/v1/auth, /api/v1/users |
| Departments | Academic Core | /api/v1/departments |
| SIS | Student Lifecycle | /api/v1/students, /api/v1/enrollments |
| Courses & Programs | Academic Core | /api/v1/programs, /api/v1/courses |
| Assignments | Learning Delivery | /api/v1/assignments |
| Quizzes | Learning Delivery | /api/v1/quizzes |
| Attendance | Learning Delivery | /api/v1/attendance |

---

### 15.2 Dependency Rules

- Courses & Programs depends on Departments
- Assignments depends on Courses & Programs and SIS
- Quizzes depends on Courses & Programs and SIS
- Attendance depends on Courses & Programs and SIS
- Exams & Results depends on Courses & Programs and SIS
- FYP depends on SIS and Notifications
- AI Chatbot depends on Licensing, RBAC, and at least one academic module
- Reporting depends on data-producing modules (Assignments, Quizzes, Attendance, Results)

If a dependency module is inactive, dependent module endpoints must return module-inactive responses.

---

### 15.3 Technical Activation Rules

- UI menu rendering checks module entitlements before route exposure
- API endpoints enforce module entitlement through policy filters
- Background jobs for a module run only when module is active
- Deactivation hides UI immediately and blocks writes; read access follows role and policy
- Reactivation restores feature access without data migration or data loss

---

### 15.4 Module State Contract

Module state should expose:

- module_key
- is_active
- source (mandatory, license, manual)
- last_changed_at
- changed_by

This contract enables auditability and deterministic behavior across UI, API, and jobs.

---

- v1 package: mandatory modules plus Courses, Assignments, Results, Notifications
- v1.1 package: Quizzes, Attendance, FYP, AI Chatbot baseline
