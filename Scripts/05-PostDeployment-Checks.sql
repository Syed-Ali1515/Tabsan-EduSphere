/*
  Post-deployment validation script for Tabsan EduSphere.
  
  PREREQUISITE SCRIPTS - MUST RUN FIRST IN THIS ORDER:
  1. 01-Schema-Current.sql      - Creates all tables and schema
  2. 02-Seed-Core.sql           - Seeds core data (roles, institutions, departments, users)
  3. 03-FullDummyData.sql       - Adds comprehensive test data
  4. 04-Maintenance-Indexes-And-Views.sql - Creates indexes and views (optional)
  5. 05-PostDeployment-Checks.sql - This script: validates data integrity

  PURPOSE:
  - Verify database schema is complete
  - Validate core data has been seeded correctly
  - Check that all prerequisite scripts ran successfully
  - Provide summary statistics for verification

  NOTE:
  - This script is read-only; it only performs SELECT queries
  - It's safe to run repeatedly
  - Use this to verify deployment success
