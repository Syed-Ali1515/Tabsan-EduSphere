  Maintenance script: Create indexes and views for Tabsan EduSphere.
  
  PREREQUISITE SCRIPTS - MUST RUN FIRST IN THIS ORDER:
  1. 01-Schema-Current.sql      - Creates all tables and schema
  2. 02-Seed-Core.sql           - Seeds core data (roles, institutions, departments, users)
  3. 03-FullDummyData.sql       - Adds comprehensive test data
  4. 04-Maintenance-Indexes-And-Views.sql - This script: creates indexes and views
  5. 05-PostDeployment-Checks.sql         - Validates data integrity (optional)

  NOTE:
  - This script is safe to run repeatedly
  - It creates indexes to improve query performance
  - It creates views for common queries
  - No data is modified; only schema-level operations
  - Use after major upgrades or bulk data imports
