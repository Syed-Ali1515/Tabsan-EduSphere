# Command Center

## Purpose
Use this file as the single handover reference between sessions and devices.
Before starting any work, the assistant must:
1. Read this file.
2. Read Project startup Docs/Final-Touches.md.
3. Continue from the exact Current Execution Pointer below.

## Non-Negotiable Rule Per Completed Stage / Phase
After **every completed stage** (not just at phase-end), update **all** required tracking files:
1. Docs/Function-List.md
2. Docs/Command.md
3. Docs/Enhancements.md
4. Docs/Issue-Fix-Phases.md
5. Project startup Docs/PRD.md
6. Project startup Docs/Database Schema.md
7. Project startup Docs/Development Plan - ASP.NET.md
8. Project startup Docs/Final-Touches.md

After every documentation update, complete mandatory Git sync in this exact order:
1. Commit all current changes
2. Pull latest remote changes (rebase preferred)
3. Push committed changes to remote

Also update this file with:
- completed work
- validation summary
- next steps
- pending extras

**Always-on documentation sync (mandatory workflow — enforced from Phase 20 onward):**
- After **every completed stage**, update ALL eight tracking files listed above before moving to the next stage.
- Do not batch documentation to phase-end.
- Keep `Docs/Function-List.md`, `Docs/Command.md`, `Docs/Enhancements.md`, `Project startup Docs/PRD.md`, `Project startup Docs/Database Schema.md`, `Project startup Docs/Development Plan - ASP.NET.md`, and `Docs/Issue-Fix-Phases.md` updated continuously as work progresses.

**Always-on Git sync (requested workflow):**
- Before ending any work session, always run full sync: commit all changes, pull from remote, then push to remote.
- Do not leave local-only completed work.
- **Always do BOTH pull and push** — pull first (rebase), then push. Never push without pulling first.
- Use this command sequence:

```powershell
cmd /c git -C "<repo-root>" add -A
cmd /c git -C "<repo-root>" commit -m "<phase/stage summary>"
cmd /c git -C "<repo-root>" pull --rebase origin main
cmd /c git -C "<repo-root>" push origin main
```

**Code quality rules (enforced from Phase 5 onward):**
- Add a `// Final-Touches Phase X Stage X.X — <description>` comment above every block of code added or changed for that phase.
- Update `Docs/Function-List.md` with a new `## Final-Touches Phase X` section listing all new/modified functions, their purpose, and file location after every completed phase.

  - Stage 27.3 commit `56cf1dd`: provider abstraction contracts for ticketing, announcements, and email
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.1 COMPLETE ✅**
  - Load-balancer readiness: forwarded headers expanded on API and added to Web.
  - Stateless web nodes: session-backed portal/API auth state replaced with protected cookies; optional shared key-ring path introduced.
  - Response compression and payload shaping: Brotli/Gzip compression enabled; null JSON fields omitted in API/Web JSON responses.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.2 COMPLETE ✅**
  - Distributed cache foundation: optional Redis-backed `IDistributedCache` added with distributed-memory fallback.
  - Hot-read sharing: module entitlement resolution and report catalog reads now use shared cache across API nodes.
  - Async workload offload: large notification fan-out batches now defer recipient insertion to a hosted background worker.
  - Report generation offload: queued result-summary export jobs now run in the background with status polling and deferred download endpoints.
  - Recalculation offload: queued result publish-all jobs now run in the background with status polling.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.3 SLICE 1 DELIVERED ✅**
  - Added configurable media storage abstraction (`IMediaStorageService`) with local filesystem provider (`LocalMediaStorageService`) and `MediaStorage` settings section.
  - Migrated student payment-proof upload endpoint to storage abstraction and object-key persistence (instead of hard-coded local file paths).
  - Added stricter upload validation reuse (`FileUploadValidator`) before persistence.
  - No schema changes required; storage references remain metadata-only in existing receipt records.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.3 SLICE 2 DELIVERED ✅**
  - Moved storage abstraction contract into the Application layer so both API controllers and Application services can share it.
  - Migrated graduation certificate generation to provider-backed persistence, storing storage keys instead of filesystem-relative webroot paths for new records.
  - Added provider-backed certificate read path in graduation downloads, with compatibility fallback for legacy `/certificates/*` records.
  - No schema changes required; existing certificate path column continues to store a metadata reference.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.3 SLICE 3 DELIVERED ✅**
  - Migrated license upload flow from direct temp-file path handling to provider-backed save/read/delete operations via `IMediaStorageService`.
  - Added bytes-based activation method in `LicenseValidationService` so license verification no longer depends on filesystem paths.
  - Added storage-provider delete support to clean temporary upload objects after activation attempts.
  - No schema changes required.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.3 SLICE 4 DELIVERED ✅**
  - Added configurable provider registration (`AddConfiguredMediaStorage`) so storage backend selection is now driven by `MediaStorage:Provider`.
  - Added `BlobMediaStorageService` adapter (object-storage style key semantics, isolated root path, reference generation).
  - Extended media storage settings with `BlobRootPath` and updated environment appsettings defaults/placeholders.
  - Local provider remains default to preserve runtime behavior unless provider is explicitly switched.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.3 SLICE 5 DELIVERED ✅**
  - Migrated portal logo upload from inline base64 return to provider-backed persistence through `IMediaStorageService`.
  - Added public logo streaming endpoint `GET /api/v1/portal-settings/logo-files/{**storageKey}` for branding rendering without bearer headers.
  - Added guarded key-category enforcement so only `portal-branding/logo` objects are served by the anonymous endpoint.
  - Preserved backward compatibility for existing `data:image/*` logo values already stored in portal settings.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.3 SLICE 6 DELIVERED ✅**
  - Extended `IMediaStorageService` with temporary read URL generation (`GenerateTemporaryReadUrlAsync`) for provider-backed signed URL workflows.
  - Added temporary signed URL generation support in both local and blob storage providers using optional `MediaStorage:SignedUrlSecret`.
  - Updated portal logo file endpoint to prefer redirecting to provider-generated temporary URLs and safely fall back to byte streaming when unavailable.
  - Added `SignedUrlSecret` placeholders to API appsettings files.
- **Phase 28 — Scalability Architecture — Stage 28.3 SLICE 7 DELIVERED ✅**
  - Enforced signed URL validation (`exp` + `sig`) on local logo streaming when `MediaStorage:SignedUrlSecret` is configured.
  - Added compatibility redirect from unsigned legacy logo URLs to short-lived signed local URLs.
  - Added fixed-time signature comparison and expiry enforcement for local signed reads.
  - Kept provider temporary URL redirect-first behavior and byte-stream fallback for operational compatibility.
- Continue through Phase 28.3+ per Docs/Advance-Enhancements.md

## Pending Extra Tasks (Cross-Phase)
- Keep Report Center menu visible by role and working links.
- Ensure all menus are assignable in Sidebar Settings.
- Ensure export button text and actions are validated when reporting phase is executed.
- Keep test credentials and run commands verified after major backend changes.

## Work Log

### Entry 024 — 2026-05-07 — Stage 5.4 Admin Reporting Scope Portal UX Completion
**Completed:**
- Added `isAdminOnly` guidance guards to all 9 report portal page actions in `Web/Controllers/PortalController.cs`:
  - `ReportAttendance`, `ReportResults`, `ReportAssignments`, `ReportQuizzes`: Admin receives friendly message when neither department nor offering is selected (mirrors existing Faculty guidance pattern).
  - `ReportGpa`, `ReportEnrollment`, `ReportSemesterResults`, `ReportFypStatus`: Admin receives friendly message when no department is selected.
  - `ReportLowAttendance`: Admin receives friendly message when neither department nor offering is selected.
- `isAdminOnly` pattern: `identity?.IsAdmin == true && !identity.IsSuperAdmin` (avoids triggering for SuperAdmin who has `IsAdmin=true`).
- No API changes needed — `EnforceAdminDepartmentScopeAsync` was already complete via Phase 6.

**Validation:**
- `dotnet build Tabsan.EduSphere.Web.csproj` — **0 errors, 0 warnings**
- Full integration suite — **78/78 tests passed**

**Architecture context (Phase 2 must follow these patterns):**
- JWT auth policies defined in `src/Tabsan.EduSphere.API/Program.cs` lines 66–69. All policies include SuperAdmin.
- License data stored in `Tabsan.EduSphere.Domain/Licensing/` entities.
- License validation service: `src/Tabsan.EduSphere.Application/Services/` (look for `LicenseService` or similar).
- Background job for license expiry warning: `src/Tabsan.EduSphere.BackgroundJobs/LicenseExpiryWarningJob.cs`.
- License import/update in portal: `src/Tabsan.EduSphere.Web/Controllers/PortalController.cs` — `LicenseUpdate` action.
- License key generator tool: `tools/KeyGen/` and `tools/Tabsan.Lic/`.

**Phase 2 Work Plan (next up):**

| ID | Work Item | Approach |
|----|-----------|----------|
| P2-S1-01 | Concurrent user limit based on `MaxUsers` in license | Track active logins in a DB table (e.g., `ActiveSessions`). On login, count active non-expired sessions. If count >= MaxUsers, reject login with HTTP 403 + meaningful message. |
| P2-S1-02 | SuperAdmin always exempt from concurrency limit | In the concurrency check, skip if role is SuperAdmin. |
| P2-S2-01 | `MaxUsers = 0` or `"All"` = unlimited mode | Treat zero/negative/`"All"` as unlimited; skip concurrency check entirely. |
| P2-S3-01 | One-time domain binding on first activation | On first license load: capture request domain, persist as `ActivatedDomain` in license entity. On subsequent loads: compare current domain — reject if mismatch. |
| P2-S3-02 | Force re-upload when domain changes | If `ActivatedDomain` is set and does not match current domain, redirect to LicenseUpdate page with an error message. |
| P2-S3-03 | HMAC anti-tamper on license file | License file signed with HMAC-SHA256 using a server secret. Validate signature before parsing payload. Reject with clear error if tampered. |

**Resume prompt for new session:**
```
Read Command.md first. Phase 1 Remediation is complete (all Done in Observed-Issues.md).
Begin Phase 2 from P2-S1-01. Refer to the Phase 2 Work Plan table in Entry 015.
Do not re-do any Phase 1 work.
When Phase 2 is complete, update: Observed-Issues.md, Command.md, PRD.md, Docs/Function-List.md.
```

**Completed: ✅ ALL Phase 2 items (P2-S1-01 through P2-S3-03)**

**Stage 2.1 — User Count-Based Concurrency Restriction + SuperAdmin Exemption (P2-S1-01, P2-S1-02):**
- Added `MaxUsers` property to `LicenseState` entity (int, default 0 = unlimited)
- Extended `LicenseValidationService.TablicPayload` to deserialize `MaxUsers` from binary .tablic payload
- Updated `LicenseValidationService.ActivateFromFileAsync(string filePath, string? requestDomain, CancellationToken)` signature to accept optional request domain
- Added `CountActiveSessionsAsync(CancellationToken)` to `IUserSessionRepository` interface
- Implemented `CountActiveSessionsAsync()` in `UserSessionRepository` — counts sessions where `RevokedAt == null && ExpiresAt > DateTime.UtcNow`
- Updated `AuthService.LoginAsync()` to:
  - Fetch current license
  - If user is NOT SuperAdmin AND MaxUsers > 0: count active sessions
  - Reject login if count >= MaxUsers via `LoginResult.Fail(LoginFailureReason.ConcurrencyLimitReached)`
  - SuperAdmin always exempt (skips concurrency check entirely)
- Changed `IAuthService.LoginAsync` return type from `LoginResponse?` to `LoginResult` (wrapper with success flag + failure reason enum)
- Added `LoginResult` class and `LoginFailureReason` enum to `AuthDtos.cs`
- Updated `AuthController.Login POST` to check `FailureReason` and return 403 for concurrency limit, 401 for invalid credentials

**Stage 2.2 — Unlimited Mode (P2-S2-01):**
- Implemented unlimited concurrency via `MaxUsers == 0` convention
- When MaxUsers is 0, concurrency check is skipped for all users (SuperAdmin logic runs first)
- Allows licenses to operate in "All Users" mode with no per-user cost

**Stage 2.3 — License Domain Binding + Anti-Tamper (P2-S3-01, P2-S3-02, P2-S3-03):**
- Added `ActivatedDomain` property to `LicenseState` entity (string?, max 253 chars per DNS spec)
- Extended `LicenseValidationService.TablicPayload` to deserialize optional `AllowedDomain` field from .tablic
- On activation, if payload contains `AllowedDomain`, it must match `requestDomain` or activation fails
- First activation captures domain: `activatedDomain = requestDomain ?? payload.AllowedDomain`
- Subsequent activations preserve existing `ActivatedDomain`
- Updated `LicenseController.Upload POST` to extract `Request.Host.Host` and pass to `ActivateFromFileAsync()`
- Created `LicenseDomainMiddleware` that:
  - Checks incoming request host against stored `LicenseState.ActivatedDomain`
  - Rejects cross-domain requests with HTTP 403 unless on whitelisted endpoints
  - Allows `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/license/upload`, `/api/v1/license/status` even on locked domain
  - Prevents single-license reuse across multiple deployments (one license per domain)
- Registered middleware in `Program.cs` pipeline before authentication
- Anti-tamper already implemented: RSA-2048 signature verification + AES-256-CBC decryption + replay guard + domain binding

**EF Core Migration:**
- Created manual migration: `20260505_Phase2LicenseConcurrency.cs`
  - Adds `MaxUsers INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column
  - Adds `ActivatedDomain NVARCHAR(253) NULL` column

### Entry 017 — 2026-05-05 — Phase 3 Complete (License App — Generator Alignment + File Security)

**Completed: ✅ ALL Phase 3 items (P3-S1-01, P3-S2-01, P3-S2-02)**

**Stage 3.1 — Generator Alignment (P3-S1-01):**
- Added `MaxUsers` (int, default 0 = unlimited) and `AllowedDomain` (string?, nullable) to `IssuedKey` model
- Configured new columns in `LicDb.OnModelCreating`: `HasDefaultValue(0)` + `HasMaxLength(253).IsRequired(false)`
- Extended `LicenseBuilder.TablicPayload` with `MaxUsers` and `AllowedDomain`; `BuildAsync` now embeds them in the JSON payload inside the encrypted .tablic binary
- Added `UpdateConstraintsAsync(IssuedKey key)` to `KeyService` — persists constraint values before license file generation
- Updated `ExportCsvAsync()` in KeyService — CSV now includes `MaxUsers` and `AllowedDomain` columns
- Updated `HandleBuildTablic` in `Program.cs`:
  - Prompts for "Max concurrent users (0 = unlimited):" — validates non-negative integer
  - Prompts for "Allowed domain (leave blank for no restriction):" — stored as lowercase or null
  - Saves constraints via `UpdateConstraintsAsync` before generating the file
  - Shows a summary block confirming MaxUsers and AllowedDomain before writing
- Updated `HandleListKeys` display — shows MaxUsers ("Unlimited" when 0) and AllowedDomain ("(any)" when null)
- Added **startup SQLite column migration** in `Program.cs`:
  - Reads `PRAGMA table_info(issued_keys)` to get existing column names
  - Adds `MaxUsers INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` and/or `AllowedDomain TEXT NULL` if missing
  - Existing `tabsan_lic.db` files are transparently upgraded on first launch

**Stage 3.2 — File Security (P3-S2-01 and P3-S2-02) — Pre-existing, Verified:**
- P3-S2-01 (Encrypt + validate): `LicCrypto.BuildTablicFile()` = AES-256-CBC + RSA-2048 sign; `LicenseValidationService` verifies on every activation
- P3-S2-02 (Reject modified payload): RSA signature over SHA-256(IV+ciphertext); private key only in tool; replay guard via `ConsumedVerificationKey` table

**Files Modified:**
- [tools/Tabsan.Lic/Models/IssuedKey.cs](tools/Tabsan.Lic/Models/IssuedKey.cs) — MaxUsers, AllowedDomain
- [tools/Tabsan.Lic/Data/LicDb.cs](tools/Tabsan.Lic/Data/LicDb.cs) — EF fluent config
- [tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/LicenseBuilder.cs](tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/LicenseBuilder.cs) — Payload extended
- [tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/KeyService.cs](tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/KeyService.cs) — UpdateConstraintsAsync, updated ExportCsvAsync
