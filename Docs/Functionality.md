## Institute Parity Behavior (Stage 7.2)

- **Institution-aware scope**: School, College, and University behavior is governed by license policy and explicit user institution assignment when present.
- **Role + institute guardrails**: Role authorization is combined with institute and assignment scope checks on report, analytics, and lifecycle-sensitive operations.
- **Menu and route consistency**: Hidden sidebar sections are enforced at portal route level, so direct URL navigation cannot bypass role/institute visibility restrictions.
- **Admin/Faculty operational scope**: Department and offering access must align with assignment and institute compatibility for parity-sensitive data surfaces.
- **Student scope model**: Students keep access to student-safe surfaces (for example transcript and dashboard context) while operational admin/faculty report endpoints remain restricted.
- **SuperAdmin scope model**: SuperAdmin retains global visibility and management capability across all licensed institution contexts.

## Advance Enhancements Behavior (Phase 23 Stage 23.2)

- **Dynamic academic vocabulary**: Institution policy now drives shared academic wording for Period, Progression, Grading, Course, and Student Group terms.
- **Vocabulary mapping behavior**:
	- University policy resolves to Semester / Progression / GPA-CGPA / Course / Batch,
	- School policy resolves to Grade / Promotion / Percentage / Subject / Class,
	- College policy resolves to Year / Progression / Percentage / Subject / Year-Group,
	- mixed policy precedence remains deterministic: University, then School, then College.
- **API contract**: Authenticated callers use `GET /api/v1/labels` to retrieve current tenant vocabulary.
- **Portal context behavior**: Dashboard module composition uses this vocabulary to keep one workflow surface while presenting institution-appropriate labels.
**Validation status**: Stage 23.2 integration verification passed (`8/8`) in `DynamicLabelIntegrationTests`.

### Stage 23.3 - Dashboard Context Switching
- Dashboard widgets and metrics are filtered by both role and institution policy (School/College/University).
- No workflow duplication: one configurable core, no cloned modules.
- Integration tests in `DashboardContextSwitchingIntegrationTests` verify:
	- Dashboard widgets adapt for all roles (SuperAdmin/Admin/Faculty/Student) and institution types (School/College/University)
	- Vocabulary adapts in dashboard context for each institution type
	- All tests passing (13/13)
- Implementation: `DashboardCompositionService`, `DashboardCompositionController`, web client and view integration.
- Status: Stage 23.3 completed and validated as of 2026-05-14.

### Stage 24.1 - License Flags
- Institution mode flags (`IncludeSchool`, `IncludeCollege`, `IncludeUniversity`) remain centrally persisted and validated.
- Save guard rejects invalid all-false payloads to keep at least one active institution mode.
- API contract enforcement:
	- `GET /api/v1/institution-policy` is accessible to authenticated roles.
	- `PUT /api/v1/institution-policy` remains restricted to SuperAdmin.
- Integration tests in `InstitutionPolicyLicenseFlagsIntegrationTests` verify:
	- role-based GET accessibility,
	- non-SuperAdmin PUT rejection (`403 Forbidden`),
	- all-false payload rejection (`400 BadRequest`),
	- valid payload persistence and read-back.
- Status: Stage 24.1 completed and validated as of 2026-05-14.

### Stage 24.2 - Backend Enforcement
- Added centralized backend module-license enforcement middleware for API paths.
- Middleware maps API route prefixes to module keys and checks `IModuleEntitlementResolver` before controller execution.
- Disabled modules now return consistent `403 Forbidden` with a clear message.
- Integration tests in `ModuleBackendEnforcementIntegrationTests` verify blocking for representative modules/endpoints:
	- courses (`/api/v1/course`),
	- reports (`/api/v1/reports`),
	- ai_chat (`/api/ai/conversations`),
	- fyp (`/api/v1/fyp/{id}`).
- Validation status: Stage 24.2 integration verification passed (`4/4`).
- Status: Stage 24.2 completed and validated as of 2026-05-14.

### Stage 24.3 - UI/Navigation Filtering
- Sidebar visibility now respects module activation state in addition to role/menu status.
- `GET /api/v1/sidebar-menu/my-visible` applies module-aware filtering so disabled module entries are hidden from navigation output.
- Portal route protection remains aligned through existing action-to-menu key guards, preventing access attempts through hidden menu keys.
- Integration tests in `SidebarMenuIntegrationTests` verify:
	- disabling `courses` hides course navigation entries,
	- disabling `reports` hides report-center/analytics navigation entries,
	- disabling `themes` hides theme-settings navigation entries.
- Validation status: Stage 24.3 sidebar integration verification passed (`17/17` for the suite).
- Status: Stage 24.3 completed and validated as of 2026-05-14.

### Stage 25.1 - Grade/Class Structure
- Student lifecycle progression surfaces now support academic-level terminology instead of fixed semester-only wording.
- API contract:
	- Added `GET /api/v1/student-lifecycle/academic-level-students/{departmentId}/{levelNumber}` for academic-level retrieval,
	- Existing `semester-students` route remains available as backward-compatible alias.
- Service contract:
	- Added `GetStudentsByAcademicLevelAsync(...)` in lifecycle service interface and implementation.
- Portal behavior:
	- Student Lifecycle page loads institution vocabulary from labels API and uses dynamic `PeriodLabel` (Semester/Grade/Year) in controls, tabs, and table headers,
	- Promotion confirmation message updated to "next academic level" wording.
- Integration tests in `StudentLifecycleIntegrationTests` verify academic-level endpoint availability for scoped Admin flows.
- Validation status: Stage 25.1 lifecycle integration verification passed (`4/4` for suite).
- Status: Stage 25.1 completed and validated as of 2026-05-14.

### Stage 25.2 - Stream Support (Grades 9-12)
- Stream assignment enforcement now requires:
	- School institution department context,
	- Grade range 9-12,
	- active target stream.
- Student subject surfaces now apply stream-aware filtering for School Grade 9-12 learners:
	- `GET /api/v1/course/offerings`,
	- `GET /api/v1/course/offerings/my`.
- Supported stream keyword handling includes Science, Biology, Computer, Commerce, and Arts, with safe compatibility fallback for legacy course naming.
- Validation status: Stage 25.2 unit verification passed in `Phase26Tests` (stream constraint scenarios covered).
- Status: Stage 25.2 completed and validated as of 2026-05-14.

### Stage 25.3 - School Grading and Promotion

### Institution Validation Phases
- **Execution Plan**: `Docs/Institution-License-Validation-Phases.md` defines 7 phases covering license binding, lifecycle, mixed-mode behavior, UI/report correctness, user import assignment, access boundaries, and SuperAdmin permission coverage.
- **Per-Phase Evidence**: Each phase must include `Implementation Summary`, `Validation Summary`, and `Status of Checks Done`.
- **Phase-End Sync**: After each phase, update required documentation and run commit/pull/push workflow.
- **Current Execution Snapshot (Phase 1)**: Authentication, license activation, policy binding, and module restriction checks succeeded; Phase 1 is complete for University-only license validation.
- **Current Execution Snapshot (Phase 2)**: School, College, and University lifecycle checks are validated with mode-specific policy flags, labels, capability matrix rows, and progression outcomes captured in `Docs/Institution-License-Validation-Phases.md`.
- **Current Execution Snapshot (Phase 3)**: Mixed-mode license combinations are validated with union policy behavior across School+College, School+University, College+University, and School+College+University.
- **Phase 3 Evidence Highlights**: Capability matrix union counts and persisted `portal_settings` flags match licensed combinations; progression endpoint remains institution-type deterministic across all combinations.
- **Validation Caveat (Current Tooling)**: Sequential mode activation in one environment currently requires resetting consumed verification keys because generated licenses reuse the same verification key.
- **Current Execution Snapshot (Phase 4)**: Charts/tables/menus/reports behavior is validated for School, College, and University across SuperAdmin, Admin, Faculty, and Student using mode-role evidence sweep artifacts in `Artifacts/Phase4/ModeRole/20260512-142021`.
- **Phase 4 Evidence Highlights**: Role-scoped dashboard context, labels vocabulary, and capability matrix rows align with mode flags; report data/export endpoints succeed for valid SuperAdmin/Admin/Faculty scopes and remain blocked for Student operational access.
- **Current Execution Snapshot (Phase 5)**: Manual admin creation and CSV import now support explicit per-user `institutionType` assignment with policy enforcement and persistence (`Artifacts/Phase5/Api/*_20260512-144212.json`).
- **Phase 5 Evidence Highlights**: Disabled institution assignment is rejected during CSV import; enabled assignment is accepted; admin list/create responses now include institution assignment where present.
- **Current Execution Snapshot (Phase 6)**: Institution data-access boundaries are validated for Admin, Faculty, and Student using scoped report export checks and role-allowed read surfaces (`Artifacts/Phase6/Access/20260512-150824/RunSummary.json`).
- **Phase 6 Evidence Highlights**: Admin and Faculty get `200` only for assigned department/offering scope, non-assigned scope is denied (`403`), missing scope is rejected (`400`), and Student remains blocked from operational report exports while catalog/dashboard context remain accessible (`200`).
- **Current Execution Snapshot (Phase 7)**: SuperAdmin full-access matrix is validated for CRUD, activation/deactivation, and cross-institution privileged visibility across School/College/University mode switches (`Artifacts/Phase7/SuperAdmin/20260512-151302/RunSummary.json`).
- **Phase 7 Evidence Highlights**: All SuperAdmin matrix checks succeeded (`35/35`), including department lifecycle actions, admin-user lifecycle actions, policy mode switching, and privileged dashboard/report/license access in every institution mode.

## Performance & Scalability

### High-Load Optimization (Phase 1)
- **Connection Pool Hardening**: Tuned SQL connection pools and timeouts across environment profiles for higher concurrency stability.
- **Hot Query Optimization**: No-tracking and split-query optimizations on inbox/sidebar read-heavy paths.
- **Short-TTL Data Caching**: Added short-lifetime cache windows for dashboard composition, sidebar visibility, and notification inbox/badge reads.
- **Safe Cache Invalidation**: Version-based invalidation on write/mutation flows to reduce stale data risk while preserving read performance.
- **Load-Test Validation Workflow**: Stage-by-stage validation with unit/integration gates and k6 progressive scale checks.

### Horizontal API Scaling (Phase 2)
- **Multi-Instance Node Identity**: Each API node can expose a unique instance id via configuration for scale-out deployments.
- **Instance Distribution Traceability**: Optional response header (`X-EduSphere-Instance`) allows request distribution validation behind load balancers.
- **Per-Node Health Visibility**: Dedicated instance health endpoint (`/health/instance`) reports node identity and uptime.
- **Scale-Out Operations Script**: Local multi-instance API launcher script supports fast Stage 2.1 baseline verification.
- **Least-Connections Load Balancing**: Stage 2.2 baseline includes Nginx least-connections policy template for active-connection-aware API request routing.
- **Load-Balancer Distribution Validation**: Automated request sampling script summarizes per-instance load share to verify balancing behavior.
- **Stateless Runtime Enforcement**: Production requires shared distributed cache and shared data-protection keys so API/Web nodes behave identically across scale-out instances.

### Endpoint Aggregation (Phase 3)
- **Dashboard Context Aggregation**: The ModuleComposition screen now receives visible modules, vocabulary, and dashboard widgets in one API response.
- **Reduced Portal Round-Trips**: One aggregated request replaces the prior three-call composition flow for the dashboard composer.

### Async and Non-Blocking IO (Phase 3)
- **Repository Async Cleanup**: Hot timetable, settings, quiz, and building/room repository reads now use direct awaited EF calls instead of task continuation bridging.
- **Non-Blocking Data Access**: Remaining high-traffic reads stay fully asynchronous so request threads are not tied up unnecessarily.

### Transport Optimization (Phase 3)
- **Compression**: Brotli and Gzip response compression remains enabled for HTTPS responses.
- **Connection Tuning**: API and Web hosts use Kestrel keep-alive and request-header timeout tuning for cleaner transport behavior.
- **Header Reduction**: Server headers are suppressed to reduce wire chatter on high-volume responses.

### Caching Strategy (Phase 4)
- **API Distributed Cache Policy**: High-cost analytics report reads now use short-TTL distributed cache entries so repeated dashboard/report requests avoid repeated heavy DB aggregation.
- **Edge and Static Caching**: Web static assets now emit configurable `Cache-Control` headers suitable for CDN/edge caching.
- **Cache Scope Control**: Shared cache keys are scoped by report type and department, and dynamic/authenticated MVC responses remain outside static cache policy.

### Load Testing Improvements (Phase 5)
- **Realistic Throughput Model**: High-scale k6 profiles now use request-rate ramps (`ramping-arrival-rate`) instead of only virtual-user ramps.
- **User Think-Time Simulation**: Randomized think-time windows now approximate user pacing across dashboard/sidebar/notification flows.
- **Distributed Generator Sharding**: Scale runs support generator-aware load splitting (`GENERATOR_TOTAL`, `GENERATOR_INDEX`) for multi-machine execution.
- **Output Discipline**: Summary-first output is now the default for routine runs, while heavy raw JSON output remains explicit diagnostics-only mode.

### Dependency Optimization (Phase 6)
- **External Call Caching**: Safe external library loan reads now use short-TTL distributed cache to reduce repeated outbound calls.
- **Resilience Hardening**: Outbound integration channels now include configurable circuit-breaker controls alongside retry and timeout behavior.
- **Blocking Risk Reduction**: Gradebook request composition removed sync-over-async result reads to keep request processing fully asynchronous.

### Background Processing (Phase 7)
- **Queue Offloading Expansion**: Account-security unlock/reset email sends now enqueue background work items to keep request latency predictable.
- **Queue Platform Selection**: Queue processing supports startup-configurable in-memory channel mode and RabbitMQ mode based on deployment model.
- **Worker-Based Delivery**: Dedicated workers process queued account-security email work items outside request handlers.

### Infrastructure Tuning (Phase 8)
- **Auto-Scaling Policy Baseline**: API, Web, and BackgroundJobs now expose startup-validated `InfrastructureTuning:AutoScaling` policy controls for deployment-safe replica scaling bounds.
- **Host Concurrency Controls**: `InfrastructureTuning:HostLimits` now drives thread-pool minimums and API/Web Kestrel concurrent-connection limits.
- **Network Throughput Tuning**: `InfrastructureTuning:NetworkStack` now controls HTTP/2 stream/keep-alive limits and outbound connection pooling limits for high-volume traffic.
- **Scaling Diagnostics**: API now exposes `/health/scaling` to verify effective infrastructure tuning baseline at runtime.

### Monitoring and Observability (Phase 9)
- **Prometheus Metrics Stack**: API now publishes OpenTelemetry metrics with Prometheus scraping support at `/metrics`.
- **Latency SLO Snapshots**: Rolling request timing snapshots expose p50, p95, and p99 latency summaries at `/health/observability`.
- **Runtime Health Coverage**: API health checks now cover database connectivity, CPU pressure, memory pressure, network resolution, and rolling error-rate thresholds.
- **Continuous Monitoring Surface**: The observability stack is designed to feed dashboards, alerts, and SLO checks without requiring schema changes.

### Progressive Load Strategy (Phase 10)
- **Incremental Scale Gates**: Phase 10 now runs stepwise gate plans across 10k, 20k, 50k, 80k, 100k, and higher tiers using a reusable orchestrator.
- **Bottleneck Isolation**: Each gate emits a bottleneck class so operators can identify whether the first limiter is API, database/dependency, infra, rate-limiting, or contract/authz related.
- **Fix-and-Retest Cycle**: The gate runner supports repeated retest attempts so a targeted fix can be revalidated against the same stage before promotion.
- **Reusable Scenario**: A single parameterized k6 scenario now supports the progressive and extended gate plans without duplicating test logic.
