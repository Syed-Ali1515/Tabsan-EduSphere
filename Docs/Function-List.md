| `ActivatedDomain` | Property (new) | `string?` (max 253) — domain where license was first activated; persisted across renewals. Enforces one-license-per-domain binding. | Domain/Licensing/LicenseState.cs |
| `IsUnlimited` | Computed property | Returns `true` when `MaxUsers <= 0`; used in concurrency checks. | Domain/Licensing/LicenseState.cs |

### Application — AuthDtos (Phase 2 additions)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |

| `LoginFailureReason` | Enum (new) | `InvalidCredentials`, `ConcurrencyLimitReached` — distinguishes failure types in login response. | Application/DTOs/Auth/AuthDtos.cs |
| `LoginResult` | Class (new) | Wrapper around `LoginResponse?` with `IsSuccess` flag and optional `FailureReason`; static factory methods `Ok()` and `Fail()`. | Application/DTOs/Auth/AuthDtos.cs |

### Application — IAuthService (Phase 2 changes)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LoginAsync` | Method signature | Return type changed from `Task<LoginResponse?>` to `Task<LoginResult>` — allows distinguishing invalid credentials from concurrency limit. | Application/Interfaces/IAuthService.cs |

### Application — AuthService (Phase 2 additions)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LoginAsync` | Method | Added concurrency limit check: if user is NOT SuperAdmin AND `license?.MaxUsers > 0`, count active sessions. If count >= MaxUsers, return `LoginResult.Fail(ConcurrencyLimitReached)`. SuperAdmin always exempt. | Application/Auth/AuthService.cs |

### Application — IUserSessionRepository (Phase 2 additions)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CountActiveSessionsAsync` | Method (new) | Returns `Task<int>` — count of sessions where `RevokedAt == null AND ExpiresAt > DateTime.UtcNow`. | Application/Interfaces/IUserSessionRepository.cs |

### Infrastructure — UserSessionRepository (Phase 2 additions)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CountActiveSessionsAsync` | Method (new) | EF Core query: `_db.UserSessions.CountAsync(s => s.RevokedAt == null && s.ExpiresAt > DateTime.UtcNow, ct)`. | Infrastructure/Repositories/UserSessionRepository.cs |

### Infrastructure — LicenseValidationService (Phase 2 changes)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TablicPayload` | Inner class | Added `MaxUsers { get; set; }` and `AllowedDomain { get; set; }` properties for deserialization from `.tablic` binary. | Infrastructure/Licensing/LicenseValidationService.cs |
| `ActivateFromFileAsync` | Method signature | Added optional `requestDomain` parameter (string?): `ActivateFromFileAsync(string filePath, string? requestDomain, CancellationToken ct)`. | Infrastructure/Licensing/LicenseValidationService.cs |
| `ActivateFromFileAsync` | Logic | If `payload.AllowedDomain` is set, must match `requestDomain` or activation fails. On first activation, captures: `activatedDomain = requestDomain ?? payload.AllowedDomain`. | Infrastructure/Licensing/LicenseValidationService.cs |

### Infrastructure — LicenseStateConfiguration (Phase 2 changes)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MaxUsers` property fluent config | Configuration | `HasDefaultValue(0)` — new column MaxUsers INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0. | Infrastructure/Persistence/Configurations/LicenseStateConfiguration.cs |

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Upload POST` | Endpoint | Extract `requestDomain = Request.Host.Host` and pass to `ActivateFromFileAsync(tempFile, requestDomain, ct)`. | API/Controllers/LicenseController.cs |

### API — LicenseDomainMiddleware (Phase 2 additions — NEW FILE)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LicenseDomainMiddleware` | Middleware (new) | Enforces domain binding at request level. If `LicenseState.ActivatedDomain` is set and doesn't match `Request.Host.Host`, rejects with HTTP 403 unless on whitelisted endpoints: `/api/v1/auth/login`, `/api/v1/license/upload`, `/api/v1/license/status`. Prevents cross-domain license reuse. | API/Middleware/LicenseDomainMiddleware.cs |

### API — Program.cs (Phase 2 changes)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Middleware registration | Program.cs | Added `app.UseMiddleware<LicenseDomainMiddleware>();` in pipeline before `app.UseAuthentication()`. | API/Program.cs |

**Phase 2 Completion Summary:**
- ✅ P2-S1-01: Concurrent user limit via MaxUsers field and CountActiveSessionsAsync()
- ✅ P2-S1-02: SuperAdmin exemption from concurrency limits
- ✅ P2-S2-01: Unlimited mode via MaxUsers == 0 convention
- ✅ P2-S3-01: Domain binding on first activation (ActivatedDomain captured)
- ✅ P2-S3-02: Domain enforcement via LicenseDomainMiddleware at request level
- ✅ P2-S3-03: Anti-tamper hardening (RSA signature + replay guard + domain binding)
- **Build**: 0 errors, all Phase 2 code compiles successfully
- **Next**: Apply migration (`dotnet ef database update`), Begin Phase 3 (License App with UI for MaxUsers/AllowedDomain configuration)

|---|---|---|---|
| `MaxUsers` | Property (new) | `int` — max concurrent users for this license; 0 = unlimited. Stored in SQLite DB and embedded in .tablic payload. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Models/IssuedKey.cs |
| `AllowedDomain` | Property (new) | `string?` — optional domain restriction (e.g. `portal.university.edu`). Null = unrestricted. Embedded in .tablic payload. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Models/IssuedKey.cs |

### Tools — LicDb (Phase 3 changes)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OnModelCreating` | EF config | Added `HasDefaultValue(0)` for MaxUsers; added `HasMaxLength(253).IsRequired(false)` for AllowedDomain. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Data/LicDb.cs |

### Tools — LicenseBuilder (Phase 3 changes)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TablicPayload` | Inner class | Added `MaxUsers { get; init; }` and `AllowedDomain { get; init; }` so both are serialized into the encrypted .tablic JSON payload. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/LicenseBuilder.cs |
| `BuildAsync` | Method | Updated to embed `key.MaxUsers` and `key.AllowedDomain` in the payload; these are now AES-256-CBC encrypted and RSA-2048 signed with the rest of the payload. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/LicenseBuilder.cs |

### Tools — KeyService (Phase 3 additions)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `UpdateConstraintsAsync` | Method (new) | Persists MaxUsers and AllowedDomain changes on an `IssuedKey` to the SQLite DB before generating its .tablic file. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/KeyService.cs |
| `ExportCsvAsync` | Method | Updated header and row format to include `MaxUsers` and `AllowedDomain` columns in exported CSV. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Services/KeyService.cs |

### Tools — Program.cs (Phase 3 changes)

| Symbol | Type | Change | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Startup DB migration | Code block | On launch: reads `PRAGMA table_info(issued_keys)`, adds `MaxUsers INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` and/or `AllowedDomain TEXT NULL` columns via `ALTER TABLE` if missing. Transparently upgrades pre-Phase-3 `tabsan_lic.db` files. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Program.cs |
| `HandleBuildTablic` | Method | Added prompts for MaxUsers (validated non-negative int, 0=unlimited) and AllowedDomain (optional, stored lowercase). Saves via `UpdateConstraintsAsync` before calling `BuildAsync`. Displays constraint summary before generating file. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Program.cs |
| `HandleListKeys` | Method | Updated display: shows `MaxUsers` ("Unlimited" when 0) and `AllowedDomain` ("(any)" when null) per row. | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Program.cs |

### Crypto — File Security (P3-S2-01 / P3-S2-02 — Pre-existing, Verified)

| Symbol | Type | Notes | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| `LicCrypto.BuildTablicFile` | Static method | Encrypts payload (AES-256-CBC, fresh IV per file) then signs `SHA-256(IV+ciphertext)` with RSA-2048 PKCS#1. All .tablic files generated by Tabsan.Lic are tamper-evident. **P3-S2-01 fulfilled.** | tools/Tabsan.Lic/Crypto/LicCrypto.cs |
| `LicenseValidationService.ActivateFromFileAsync` | Method | Verifies magic header, RSA signature, decrypts AES, prevents replay via `ConsumedVerificationKey` table. Any payload modification invalidates the RSA signature — rejected before parsing. **P3-S2-02 fulfilled.** | src/Infrastructure/Licensing/LicenseValidationService.cs |

---

**Phase 3 Completion Summary:**
- ✅ P3-S1-01: Generator aligned — MaxUsers and AllowedDomain flow from IssuedKey → TablicPayload → encrypted .tablic binary
- ✅ P3-S2-01: File encryption + load-time signature validation — fully implemented (pre-existing, verified)
- ✅ P3-S2-02: Modified payload rejection — RSA signing makes tampering detectable (pre-existing, verified)
- **Build**: `Tabsan.Lic` 0 errors; full solution 0 errors
- **Next**: Phase 4 — CSV User Import (P4-S1-01 through P4-S3-01)
