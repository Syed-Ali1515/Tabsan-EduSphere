**Document Version:** 2.0 (Merged Comprehensive)  
**Date:** May 11, 2026  
**Project Status:** Phase 33 (Hosting Configuration and Security Hardening)  
**Last Updated:** Based on PRD v1.58 and complete codebase exploration  

## Institute Parity Documentation Governance (2026-05-13)

For every completed stage under `Docs/Institute-Parity-Issue-Fix-Phases.md`, the stage entry must include:
- `Implementation Summary`
- `Validation Summary`

After each completed stage, this document must be updated to reflect any net functionality behavior change for School/College/University parity, including role/institute filters and report behavior.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 0.1 Audit Snapshot

- Completed baseline functional inventory for parity-scope modules (timetable, courses, buildings/rooms, departments, assignments, enrollments, reports, results, quizzes, lifecycle, payments, settings surfaces).
- Confirmed broad endpoint/service/repository coverage already exists for all target modules, with role guards primarily centered on SuperAdmin/Admin/Faculty/Student authorization and department/offering scoping.
- Identified remaining University-default behavior hotspots in branding/onboarding/prompt/template text and default policy assumptions, now queued into subsequent parity implementation stages.
- No user-visible functionality was changed in this stage; this is a validated baseline mapping update.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 0.2 Access Matrix Snapshot

- Completed role/institute access matrix baseline across core modules and operations (view/create/edit/deactivate/export).
- Confirmed effective enforcement pattern is currently mixed:
    - explicit institution policy flags at platform level,
    - operational scoping mainly through department assignment, course-offering ownership, and student self-ownership.
- Identified parity risk areas:
    - institute-specific checks not explicit on all mutation paths,
    - School/College filter coverage still incomplete on selected analytics/report surfaces.
- No runtime behavior changes were introduced in Stage 0.2; this is baseline authorization/scope mapping evidence for upcoming remediation stages.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 0.3 Report Failure Snapshot

- Completed baseline inventory of report failures and report-adjacent operational failure modes.
- Confirmed previously observed critical failures are resolved:
    - Result Summary runtime exception,
    - Report Center visibility gaps for privileged roles.
- Classified remaining report parity risks:
    - incomplete explicit School/College/University filter propagation,
    - expected scope-guard failures that require UX/API clarity,
    - sparse dummy data causing empty outputs in some report scenarios.
- This stage introduced no runtime code change; it establishes a tagged failure backlog for Phase 4 and Phase 5 execution.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 0.4 Exit Snapshot

- Completed Phase 0 sign-off by consolidating module audit, role/institute matrix, and report failure inventory into a prioritized execution backlog.
- Confirmed functional reference readiness for parity implementation phases:
    - authorization and scope hardening (Phase 2),
    - module workflow parity (Phase 3),
    - report/analytics parity fixes (Phase 4),
    - data-completeness hardening (Phase 5).
- No runtime functionality changed in Stage 0.4; this is governance and execution-readiness closure for Phase 0.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 1.1 Normalization Snapshot

- Added canonical institute dimension normalization for departments by introducing persisted `InstitutionType` (School/College/University) with default compatibility set to University.
- Department create/update API flows now enforce license policy constraints for institution type selection, preventing assignment to disabled modes.
- Department read payloads now expose institution type to support downstream parity-aware UI/API behavior.
- Existing department CRUD behavior remains backward-compatible for current University-first flows because create defaults and update optionals preserve prior request shapes.
- Stage 1.1 establishes the schema and contract base for follow-on institute-scoped referential and indexing hardening in Stage 1.2.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 1.2 Referential Integrity + Indexing Snapshot

- Added referential guards on academic write paths:
    - course create now requires valid department,
    - offering create now requires valid course/semester and faculty-department assignment when faculty is provided,
    - student profile creation now enforces program-department alignment.
- Normalized academic program uniqueness to department scope (`Code + DepartmentId`) for parity-safe multi-department operation.
- Added institute/report-heavy index coverage on programs, courses, offerings, student profiles, enrollments, and role-assignment lookup paths to reduce filter/join overhead.
- Updated enrollment status storage to bounded string length for SQL index support on active-status query paths.
- Behavior impact: invalid cross-scope academic links now fail early with explicit validation errors, while existing valid workflows remain backward-compatible.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 1.3 Script Hardening Snapshot

- Hardened deployment SQL scripts to mirror Stage 1.1/1.2 runtime schema behavior for script-first rollout paths.
- `01-Schema-Current.sql` now includes idempotent parity migration-aligned blocks for department institution dimension and Stage 1.2 index/column updates.
- `04-Maintenance-Indexes-And-Views.sql` now enforces parity-critical index presence with safe existence guards.
- `05-PostDeployment-Checks.sql` now emits explicit parity verification signals for migration IDs, column presence/shape, and critical index existence.
- User-visible runtime behavior is unchanged by Stage 1.3 itself; this stage improves deployment safety and consistency across environments.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 1.4 Exit Criteria Snapshot

- Completed Phase 1 exit verification enablement for institute parity schema/data integrity checks.
- Post-deployment verification now explicitly reports:

    - orphan counts across institute-linked academic relations and assignment links.
- Runtime behavior impact:
    - no API contract or user-flow mutation in Stage 1.4,
    - improved operational confidence by making Phase 1 exit criteria auditable with deterministic SQL check outputs.

- Behavior impact:
    - Admin/Faculty report access is now constrained by both role scope and institute scope where explicit institution assignment exists,
    - SuperAdmin behavior remains global and unchanged,
    - existing report export contracts and metadata remain stable.

## 2026-05-13 Update - Institute Parity Stage 2.3 Menu/Action Guard Consistency Snapshot

- Added portal-level guard consistency enforcement so direct portal URL navigation must match visible sidebar menu permissions for non-SuperAdmin users.
- Introduced a centralized action-to-menu key map in `PortalController` to keep menu visibility and invokable portal section routes aligned.
- Preserved SuperAdmin unrestricted behavior while applying deterministic redirect-on-deny behavior for hidden sections.

└────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Design Patterns Used

#### 1. Repository Pattern
- Abstraction over data persistence
- 40+ repository interfaces
- LINQ-based queries with Entity Framework Core
- Generic repository base class

```csharp
public interface IStudentRepository
{
    Task<Student> GetByIdAsync(int id);
    Task<IEnumerable<Student>> GetByDepartmentAsync(int deptId);
    Task AddAsync(Student student);
    Task UpdateAsync(Student student);
}
```

#### 2. Service Pattern
- Business logic encapsulation
- 50+ application services
- Dependency injection via constructor
- Service orchestration for complex operations

```csharp
public interface IEnrollmentService
{
    Task<EnrollmentResponse> EnrollAsync(int studentId, EnrollRequest request);
    Task DropAsync(int enrollmentId);
    Task<IEnumerable<EnrollmentResponse>> GetForStudentAsync(int studentId);
}
```

#### 3. DTO Pattern
- Request/Response DTOs for API contracts
- Type-safe data transfer
- Input validation via FluentValidation
- Mapping from/to domain entities

```csharp
public class EnrollRequest
{
    public int CourseOfferingId { get; set; }
    [Required]
    public bool OverrideTimetableClash { get; set; }
}
```

#### 4. Dependency Injection
- Constructor-based DI
- Service registration in startup
- Interface-based abstractions
- Loose coupling between components

#### 5. Specification Pattern (Optional)
- Complex query specifications
- Reusable query logic
- Linq-based predicates
- Domain query logic encapsulation

## API Patterns & Data Flows

### Standard CRUD Pattern
```
GET    /api/v1/{resource}              List all
GET    /api/v1/{resource}/{id}         Get single
POST   /api/v1/{resource}              Create
PUT    /api/v1/{resource}/{id}         Update
DELETE /api/v1/{resource}/{id}         Delete
```

### Domain-Specific Patterns
```
POST   /api/v1/enrollments/enroll              Enroll student
POST   /api/v1/enrollments/{id}/drop           Drop enrollment
POST   /api/v1/assignments/{id}/publish        Publish assignment
POST   /api/v1/attendance/bulk-mark            Bulk mark attendance
GET    /api/v1/gradebook/{offeringId}         Get gradebook grid
POST   /api/v1/results/publish-all             Publish all results
GET    /api/v1/timetable/export/{id}/pdf      Export timetable
```

### Request → Response Flow
```
Client Request
    ↓
API Controller (validation, auth check)
    ↓
Middleware (logging, error handling)
    ↓
Application Service (business logic)
    ↓
Domain Model (invariant enforcement)
    ↓
Repository Interface (abstraction)
    ↓
Infrastructure (EF Core, SQL Server)
    ↓
Database Query Execution
    ↓
Response DTO → JSON → Client
```

### Notification Fan-Out Pattern
```
SendAsync() → Create Notification
    ↓
FanOutRecipientsAsync() → Create NotificationRecipient rows
    ↓
Queue for async dispatch (if > 250 recipients)
    ↓
User inbox fetch with Read tracking
    ↓
Notification history maintenance
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```
Controller try-catch
    ↓
Service exception handling
    ↓
Custom exception mapping
    ↓
HTTP status code response
    ↓
Error detail JSON response
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

#### Database Level
- Indexed searches on commonly queried fields
- Composite indexes on (StudentId, CourseOfferingId, Date)
- Foreign key indexes
- Archive policies for old data
- Query optimization

#### Application Level
- Pagination for large datasets
- Lazy loading of navigation properties
- Batch operations for bulk imports
- Async operations throughout
- Caching strategies

#### Caching Strategy
- Role caching (30-minute TTL)
- Menu/sidebar caching (1-hour TTL)
- Settings caching (1-hour TTL)
- Result caching (varies by operation)
- Semester/program caching (daily TTL)

#### Query Optimization
```csharp
// Inefficient: N+1 queries
var students = _repository.GetAll();  // Query 1
foreach(var student in students)      // Query N
    var enrollments = student.Enrollments;

// Optimized: Single query with Include
var students = _repository.GetAll()
    .Include(s => s.Enrollments)
    .ToList();  // Query 1
```

### Common Performance Hotspots

1. **Gradebook Grid Loading** - Use pagination/lazy loading
2. **Full-Text Search** - Implement indexed search
3. **Attendance Bulk Mark** - Use batch insert operations
4. **Report Generation** - Run asynchronously with queuing
5. **Notification Dispatch** - Use fan-out queue for large audiences
