# Faculty User Guide

Version: 1.2  
Date: 14 May 2026  
Completion Status: Phase 31 Stage 31.3

## 1. Purpose

This guide explains faculty workflows in Tabsan EduSphere: teaching setup, assignments, quizzes, attendance, results, FYP supervision, and notifications.

## 1.1 What's New (May 2026)

- Institution-aware vocabulary now appears in key screens (for example Semester vs Grade vs Year) based on active policy.
- Advanced analytics now available for faculty: performance trends and class-level comparative metrics for assigned offerings (Phase 31.2).
- Analytics exports to PDF/Excel are standardized with deterministic naming; large exports are processed as queued jobs (Phase 31.3).
- Report and analytics requests now enforce assignment plus institute compatibility more strictly.
- Parent notification fan-out is supported for published results and selected academic alerts where parent module is active.
- Export behavior for analytics/reporting is standardized across synchronous and queued job paths.

## 2. Login and Role Scope

Faculty accounts are created by SuperAdmin or Admin. After login, your access depends on:
- Assigned role: Faculty
- Assigned department
- Assigned course offerings
- Active modules

If menus are missing, contact your admin to verify role and module assignment.

## 3. Faculty Dashboard

Dashboard highlights typically include:
- Pending submissions to grade
- Upcoming class sessions
- Attendance alerts
- Recent student notifications
- FYP meeting reminders

Recommended routine: review dashboard at the start and end of each teaching day.

## 3.1 Role and Institute Filter Behavior

Faculty scope is filtered by role, offering assignment, and institution context:
- Visible operational menus and data are constrained to assigned offerings and institute-compatible departments.
- Report and analytics surfaces enforce assignment + institution compatibility.
- Requests outside authorized scope can return access-denied responses by design.

If expected data is missing, confirm offering assignment and selected filters with your Admin.

- **Queued Export**: Large class exports or complex reports are processed asynchronously. You receive a reference ID and email notification when complete.

When viewing student records or analytics, terminology will automatically adjust. No configuration is needed; it is driven by the active institution license policy.
