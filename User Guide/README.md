- Some screens can look slightly different depending on theme and deployment settings.
- Audit-sensitive actions such as publishing results and system-level changes are logged.
- User import templates are now role-specific under User Import Sheets: faculty-admin-import-template.csv and students-import-template.csv.
- Standard database deployment run order is Scripts/01-Schema-Current.sql through Scripts/05-PostDeployment-Checks.sql.
- Consolidated planning and enhancement history is maintained in Docs/Consolidated-Execution-Enhancements-Issues.md.
